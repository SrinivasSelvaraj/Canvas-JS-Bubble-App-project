# Canvas-JS-Bubble-App-project
**Bubbles App** 

This application demonstrates a simple interactive canvas drawing with circles and arrows. Each circle represents a target, and clicking inside a circle causes an arrow to move towards it, changing the color of the circle once hit.

**File Structure:**
- index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the application, including canvas setup, buttons, and script inclusion.
- styles.css: Contains the CSS styles for the application, including centering elements and basic styling.
- script.js: Contains the JavaScript code for the application, including drawing circles and arrows, handling click events, and managing animation.

**Functionality:**
- The canvas is used to draw circles (targets) and arrows (projectiles).
- Clicking inside a circle triggers an arrow to move towards it from the right side of the canvas.
- Once an arrow hits a circle, the circle's color changes to gray.
- The "Reset" button reloads the page, resetting the canvas to its initial state.

**Usage:****
- Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the application.
- Click inside a circle to see an arrow move towards it and change the circle's color.

_Note:_ This is a basic demonstration and can be extended with additional features and improvements.
